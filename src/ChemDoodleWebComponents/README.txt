ChemDoodle Web Components

=====
ABOUT
=====

The ChemDoodle Web Components library is a pure Javascript chemical graphics and cheminformatics library derived from the ChemDoodle(R) application and produced by iChemLabs. ChemDoodle Web Components allow the wielder to present publication quality 2D and 3D graphics and animations for chemical structures, reactions and spectra. Beyond graphics, this tool provides a framework for user interaction to create dynamic applications through web browsers, desktop platforms and mobile devices such as the iPhone, iPad and Android devices. This library also has complete access to the entire ChemDoodle desktop API through AJAX, allowing for quick access to one of the most robust chemical graphics and informatics packages in existence directly through Javascript.
