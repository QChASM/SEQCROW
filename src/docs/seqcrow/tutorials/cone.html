        <h1>Cone Angles</h1>
            <p>
                Cone angles are one of the more iconic measurements for the size
                of ligands. SEQCROW can employ two methods for calculating cone angles:
                Tolman's cone angle for unsymmetric ligands
                <sup><a href="#Ref">1</a></sup>
                and exact cone angles<sup><a href="#Ref">2</a></sup>.
                The latter can only be used on mono- or bidentate ligands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tolman cone angles essentially measure the size of the different
                groups on the ligand's coordinating atoms, with some dependence on
                the L-M-L angle for bidentate ligands. Tolman built upscaled models 
                of ligands, and used those to determine cone angles. Modern
                computational methods allow us to use ligand structures that have
                been optimized with DFT or other methods. This alleviates some concerns
                about the empirical parameters Tolman originally used.
                Of course, cone angles calculated from DFT-optimized structures are
                not always comparable to ones calculated using physical model kits
                or the original empirical constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exact cone angles use rigorous trigonometry to determine the smallest
                cone that can enclose the ligand with the apex at the metal center.
                This minimum enclosing cone depends on at most three of the ligand's
                atoms. Exact cone angles have remained relatively neglected, possibly
                due to challenges in implementing the method or executing the
                original code. While neither of these should concern the reader,
                exact cone angles have not proven to be as useful as a steric
                parameter for correlating with reactivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this tutorial, you'll see how to calculate Tolman and exact cone
                angles for ligands. The process is similar to both, so the process
                will only be described once.
            </p>

        <h2>Cone Angles for a BINAP ligand</h2>
            <p>
                We'll calculate the cone angles for a BINAP ligand. To begin,
                open the structure using the command below:
                <br>
                <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QChASM/AaronTools.py/master/test/test_files/catalysts/tm_multi-lig.xyz">
                open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QChASM/AaronTools.py/master/test/test_files/catalysts/tm_multi-lig.xyz
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, open the cone angle tool:
                <br>
                <span class="menulike">Tools &rarr; Structure Analysis &rarr; Cone Angle</span>
                <br>
                or run the command:
                <br>
                <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Cone Angle&quot;">
                ui tool show "Cone Angle"
                </a>
            </p>
            <aside>

                Exact cone angle and radii for ligand atoms
            </aside>
            <p>
                This tool has several options. The first is the method for calculating
                the cone angle. These methods are described above. You can also choose
                which set of VDW radii to use. This choice doesn't matter as much,
                though UMN covers more of the periodic table. You can also visualize
                the results. For Tolman cone angles, there will be one cone for 
                every group on the coordinating atoms. For exact cone angles, there
                will be only one cone. The radii of the ligand atoms can be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select the diphosphine ligand. An easy way to do this is to use the
                "Select Fragment" mouse mode, which can be activated from the 
                "More Right Mouse" tab the the ChimeraX toolbar. You can also
                run the following command:
                <br>
                <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select P;select connected">
                select P;select connected"
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                On the tool window, press <button>set ligand to current selection</button>.
                Next, clear your selection and select only the ruthenium atom.
                Press <button>calculate cone angle
                for selected center</button>. After a moment, the cone angle
                should appear in the table in the bottom part of the tool window.
                If you used UMN radii for the exact cone angle, you should 
                get a value of 233.4°. The Tolman cone angle is 273.6°.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data table can be exported to a CSV file using the 
                <span class="menulike">Export</span> menu on the tool window. 
                The data table can also be cleared under the same menu.
            </p>
