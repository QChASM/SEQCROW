		<h1>Buried Volume</h1>
			<p>
				Buried volume has proven to be a useful parameter for gauging steric
				bulk of a ligand around a catalyst center (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/om034016k">
				https://doi.org/10.1021/om034016k</a>). Here, you will see how to calculate
				and visualize buried volume using SEQCROW.
			</p>
		

		<h2>Buried Volume of an N-Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</h2>
			<p>
				In this tutorial, we'll measure the %V<sub>bur</sub> of 
				1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (IPr) on a metal
				center. Click the command below	to open a structure of an
				Ru(II) complex with an IPr ligand:
				<br>
				<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QChASM/SEQCROW/images_for_wiki/strux/Ru_Cp-star_IPr_Cl_10.1021.om034016k.xyz">open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QChASM/SEQCROW/images_for_wiki/strux/Ru_Cp-star_IPr_Cl_10.1021.om034016k.xyz
				</a>
				<br>
				This structure is from the article mentioned above.
			</p>
			<h3>Setting the Settings</h3>
				<p>
					Now, open the buried volume tool (<span class=menulike>
					Tools &rarr; Structure Analysis &rarr; Buried Volume</span> or
					run the command
					<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Buried Volume&quot;">
					ui tool show "Buried Volume"</a>).
				</p>
				<p>
					The tool offers a few options we can tweak. The first is the VDW radii to
					use. There's not much of a difference between the "UMN" and "Bondi" radii,
					other than the "UMN" radii cover more of the periodic table.
					There's also the option to scale the VDW radii to account for 
					Real Molecules not being totally static, like this structure.
				</p>

				<p>
					The next thing we can do is specify the atoms to include in the buried 
					volume calculation by selecting them. 
					To calculate the buried volume of this ligand, we need to select the entire
					ligand and click the <button>set ligands to current selection</button>
					on the tool window. For this particular structure, a concise way to select
					the ligand is to select just one atom on the ligand and then employ the
					'connected' selector (<span class="menulike">Select &rarr;
					Structure &rarr; Connected</span>). The 'connected' selector expands the
					current selection to everything with a bonding path to the current
					selection. The following command is also effective:
					<br>
					<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select N; select connected">select
					N; select connected</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, we choose the radius around the metal center. This defines the
					total volume, and the %V<sub>bur</sub> is the portion of this sphere
					that is taken up by the VDW radii of the ligand. For the purpose of
					this tutorial, we'll use 3.0 Å. This radius should be chosen to 
					capture the parts of the ligand that likely do interact with substrates.
					For other systems, different radii should be tested.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can also choose what algorithm to use to integrate this volume.
					The "Lebedev" option uses a Lebedev quadrature of the angular component
					of the sphere and a Gauss-Legendre quadrature for the radial component. 
					For this method, we can choose how many points to use for the angular
					and radial components. More points will result in lower error, but 
					it will also take longer to calculate %V<sub>bur</sub>. With sufficient
					points, the error in calculated %V<sub>bur</sub> should be negligible. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The other option we have is Monte-Carlo integration. For this, we can
					choose the minimum MC iterations (each iteration samples 3000 points).
					Regardless of the specified iterations, the MC algorithm will continue
					until it converges (%V<sub>bur</sub> changes by &lt; 0.01 over the last 
					four iterations and the average change over the last four iterations is
					&lt; 0.01). The sign of the error from the MC method is random, but will
					typically fall within ± 0.3 of the expected value.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next option, 'use centroid of centers' might be useful for calculating
					the buried volume at the centroid of key atoms on a polydentate ligand.
					We'll leave that unchecked for this tutorial.
				</p>
				<p>
					Simply select the ruthenium and press <button>calculate % buried
					volume for selected centers</button>. The %V<sub>bur</sub>
					value should appear in the table on the lower half of the tool.
					you should get a value around 28%.
				</p>

			<h3>Visualization options</h3>
				<p>
					Now that we've calculated the buried volume, let's take a look at the
					visualization options. These are all on the 'visualization' tab of the
					tool. To generate visuals, the buried volume will have to be 
					re-computed. 
				</p>
				<h4>Steric Map</h4>
				<p>
					A steric map can be generated for the ligand. A steric map is a contour
					plot of a 2-D projection of the VDW radii of the ligand's atoms. 
					This can provide insight into areas where the steric bulk of the ligand
					is encroaching on the center or where the center is relatively open. 
					Let's turn this option on for the purpose of this tutorial. <b>Note</b> -
					VDW radii are scaled for %V<sub>bur</sub> calculations, but not for
					steric maps.
				</p>
				<p>
					When generating a steric map, the default is to orient the projection of
					the VDW radii such that the average of the vectors from the coordinating
					atoms to the center is orthogonal to the plane. For our monodentate ligand,
					this means the C-Ru bond defines the plane onto which everything is projected. 
					The y-axis of the plot is defined as orthogonal to the
					plane-of-best-fit of the center and any coordinating atoms. This typically
					makes sense for polydentate ligands. For a monodentate ligand, this is 
					going to be random, which may or may not be useful. 
				</p>
				<aside>
					<img src="../images/Ru_IPr.png"/>
					<br>
					<img src="../images/steric_map.jpg" width=256px/>
				</aside>
				<p>
					To eliminate this randomness, we can check the 'use display orientation'
					box. With this box checked, the steric map will use whatever orientation
					the structure appears on the screen. Check the box, and align 
					the structure so you are looking down the Ru-C bond and the N's 
					lie close to the x-axis:
					<br>
					<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:lookDown @N1 atom2 @N2 axis x">
					lookDown @N1 atom2 @N2 axis x
					</a>
					<br>
					<a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:lookDown Ru atom2 @C11">
					lookDown Ru atom2 @C11
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					The next option, 'number of points', specifies how many points should be along
					the x- and y-axis of the steric map. Increasing this will make the map look
					more smooth, but take considerably longer to generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					The quadrant can also be labeled with the %V<sub>bur</sub> in each by checking
					the 'label quadrant with %V<sub>bur</sub>' box. This will also cause the
					buried volume to be reported for each individual quadrant back on the 
					'calculation' tab.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can also choose the shape of the map: circle or square. Given that %V<sub>bur</sub>
					is calculated using a sphere around the Ru, we'll use 'circle'. The square option
					might be useful for generating a steric map of a small molecule, however. 
					The 'radius around center' option back on the 'calculation' tab determines the
					radius of the circle (or the apothem of the square) on the steric map.
				</p>
				<p>
					By default, the minimum and maximum of the steric map are chosen automatically
					based on the highest and lowest altitudes on the map. If you are comparing
					steric maps for other ligands, it may be more useful to have a set minimum and
					maximum. To do this, simply uncheck the 'automatic min. and max.' box and
					choose your desired minimum and maximum values. For the purposes of this
					tutorial, we'll be keeping 'automatic min. and max.' checked.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Volume Cutout</h4>
				<aside>
					<img src="../images/Ru_IPr_cutout.png"/>
					<br>
					Cp* and Cl hidden for clarity
				</aside>
				<p>
					The volume around the center that is free or buried can also be visualized.
					This is mostly useful for double checking that all the intended ligand atoms 
					were included in the %V<sub>bur</sub> calculation, but it also looks nice.
					For this tutorial, we'll create a volume cutout for the buried volume.
				</p>
				<p>
					Gaps may appear in the volume cutout. To make these gaps smaller,
					you can try using a finer point spacing or a higher intersection
					density. Higher values of both of these will cause the volume
					cutout to take longer to generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					To generate these visuals, flip back to the 'calculation' tab of the tool
					and press <button>calculate % buried volume for selected centers</button>.
