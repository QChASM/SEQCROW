        <h1>Buried Volume</h1>
            <p>
                Buried volume has proven to be a useful parameter for gauging steric
                bulk of a ligand around a catalyst center (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/om034016k">
                https://doi.org/10.1021/om034016k</a>). The percent buried volume, or
                %V<sub>bur</sub>, is the percentage of the volume around a catalyst center
                that is taken up by the ligand atoms. Unlike cone angles, this parameter
                focuces on steric bulk up close to the center, whereas cone angles can be set
                by atoms that are far from the substrate. Here, you will see how to calculate
                and visualize buried volume using SEQCROW.
            </p>
        

        <h2>Buried Volume of an N-Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</h2>
            <p>
                In this tutorial, we'll measure the %V<sub>bur</sub> of 
                1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (IPr) on a metal
                center. Click the command below    to open a structure of an
                Ru(II) complex with an IPr ligand:
                <br>
                <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QChASM/SEQCROW/images_for_wiki/strux/Ru_Cp-star_IPr_Cl_10.1021.om034016k.xyz">open https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QChASM/SEQCROW/images_for_wiki/strux/Ru_Cp-star_IPr_Cl_10.1021.om034016k.xyz
                </a>
                <br>
                This structure is from the article mentioned above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, open the buried volume tool (<span class=menulike>
                Tools &rarr; Structure Analysis &rarr; Buried Volume</span> or
                run the command
                <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:ui tool show &quot;Buried Volume&quot;">
                ui tool show "Buried Volume"</a>).
            </p>
            <h3>Setting the Settings</h3>
               <p>
                    The tool offers a few options we can tweak over on the "settings"
					tab. The first is the VDW radii to
                    use. There's not much of a difference between the "UMN" and "Bondi" radii,
                    other than the "UMN" radii cover more of the periodic table.
                    There's also the option to scale the VDW radii to account for 
                    Real Molecules not being totally static, like this structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we choose the radius around the metal center. The radius around the
					metal center defines the total volume, and the %V<sub>bur</sub>
					is the portion of this sphere that is taken up by the VDW radii of
					the ligand. For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll use 3.0 Å. This
					radius should be chosen to capture the parts of the ligand that
					likely do interact with substrates. For other systems, different
					radii should be tested. 3.0 Å was chosen here simply to provide
					a comparison with the reference above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can also choose what algorithm to use to integrate this volume.
                    The "Lebedev" option uses a Lebedev quadrature of the angular component
                    of the sphere and a Gauss-Legendre quadrature for the radial component. 
                    For this method, we can choose how many points to use for the angular
                    and radial components. More points will result in lower error, but 
                    it will also take longer to calculate %V<sub>bur</sub>. With sufficient
                    points, the error in calculated %V<sub>bur</sub> should be negligible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other option we have is Monte-Carlo integration. For this, we can
                    choose the minimum MC iterations (each iteration samples 3000 points).
                    Regardless of the specified iterations, the MC algorithm will continue
                    until it converges (%V<sub>bur</sub> changes by &lt; 0.01 over the last 
                    four iterations and the average change over the last four iterations is
                    &lt; 0.01). The sign of the error from the MC method is random, but will
                    typically fall within ± 0.3 of the expected value.
                </p>
			<h3>Calculating Buried Volume</h3>

                    <img src="../images/Vbur_IPr.jpg" width=256px/>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    Now we need to specify the ligand atoms to include in the buried 
                    volume calculation by selecting them. Flip back to the "calculation" tab.
                    To calculate the buried volume of this ligand, we need to select the entire
                    ligand and click the <button>set ligands to current selection</button>
                    on the tool window. For this particular structure, a concise way to select
                    the ligand is to select just one atom on the ligand and then employ the
                    'connected' selector (<span class="menulike">Select &rarr;
                    Structure &rarr; Connected</span>). The 'connected' selector expands the
                    current selection to everything with a bonding path to the current
                    selection. The following command is also effective:
                    <br>
                    <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:select N; select connected">select
                    N; select connected</a>
                    <br>
                    Another option is to use the "Select Fragment" mouse mode, which can
                    be turned on by going to the "More Right Mouse" tab of the ChimeraX toolbar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next option, 'use centroid of centers' might be useful for calculating
                    the buried volume at the centroid of key atoms on a polydentate ligand
					that is not bound to a metal. We'll leave that unchecked for this tutorial.
                </p>
				<p>
					Finally, select the ruthenium atom and press <button>calculate % buried
                    volume for selected centers</button>. The %V<sub>bur</sub>
                    value should appear in the table on the lower half of the tool.
                    you should get a value around 28%. This is in line with the value
					reported in table 3 of the reference mentioned above. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data table can be exported to a CSV file using the 
                    <span class="menulike">Export</span> menu on the tool window. 
                    The data table can also be cleared under the same menu.
                </p>

            <h3>Visualization options</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we've calculated the buried volume, let's take a look at the
                    visualization options. These are all on the 'visualization' tab of the
                    tool. To generate visuals, the buried volume will have to be 
                    re-computed. 
                </p>
                <h4>Steric Map</h4>
                <p>
                    A steric map can be generated for the ligand. A steric map is a contour
                    plot of a 2-D projection of the VDW radii of the ligand's atoms. 
                    This can provide insight into areas where the steric bulk of the ligand
                    is encroaching on the center or where the center is relatively open. 
                    Let's turn this option on for the purpose of this tutorial. <b>Note</b> -
                    VDW radii are scaled for %V<sub>bur</sub> calculations, but not for
                    steric maps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When generating a steric map, the default is to orient the projection of
                    the VDW radii such that the average of the vectors from the coordinating
                    atoms to the center is orthogonal to the plane. For our monodentate ligand,
                    this means the C-Ru bond defines the plane onto which everything is projected. 
                    The y-axis of the plot is defined as orthogonal to the
                    plane-of-best-fit of the center and any coordinating atoms. This typically
                    makes sense for polydentate ligands. For a monodentate ligand, this is 
                    going to be random, which may or may not be useful. 
                </p>
                <aside>
                    <img src="../images/Ru_IPr.png"/>
                    <br>
                    <img src="../images/steric_map.jpg" width=256px/>
                </aside>
                <p>
                    To eliminate this randomness, we can check the 'use display orientation'
                    box. With this box checked, the steric map will use whatever orientation
                    the structure appears on the screen. Check the box, and align 
                    the structure so you are looking down the Ru-C bond and the N's 
                    lie close to the x-axis:
                    <br>
                    <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:lookDown @N1 atom2 @N2 axis x">
                    lookDown @N1 atom2 @N2 axis x
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <a class="cxcmd" href="cxcmd:lookDown Ru atom2 @C11">
                    lookDown Ru atom2 @C11
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next option, 'number of points', specifies how many points should be along
                    the x- and y-axis of the steric map. Increasing this will make the map look
                    more smooth, but take considerably longer to generate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The quadrant can also be labeled with the %V<sub>bur</sub> in each by checking
                    the 'label quadrant with %V<sub>bur</sub>' box. This will also cause the
                    buried volume to be reported for each individual quadrant back on the 
                    'calculation' tab.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can also choose the shape of the map: circle or square. Given that %V<sub>bur</sub>
                    is calculated using a sphere around the Ru, we'll use 'circle'. The square option
                    might be useful for generating a steric map of a small molecule, however. 
                    The 'radius around center' option back on the 'calculation' tab determines the
                    radius of the circle (or the apothem of the square) on the steric map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default, the minimum and maximum of the steric map are chosen automatically
                    based on the highest and lowest altitudes on the map. If you are comparing
                    steric maps for other ligands, it may be more useful to have a set minimum and
                    maximum. To do this, simply uncheck the 'automatic min. and max.' box and
                    choose your desired minimum and maximum values. For the purposes of this
                    tutorial, we'll be keeping 'automatic min. and max.' checked.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Volume Cutout</h4>
                <aside>
                    <img src="../images/Ru_IPr_cutout.png"/>
                    <br>
                    Cp* and Cl hidden for clarity
                </aside>
                <p>
                    The volume around the center that is free or buried can also be visualized.
                    This is mostly useful for double checking that all the intended ligand atoms 
                    were included in the %V<sub>bur</sub> calculation, but it also looks nice.
                    For this tutorial, we'll create a volume cutout for the buried volume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gaps may appear in the volume cutout. To make these gaps smaller,
                    you can try using a finer point spacing or a higher intersection
                    density. Higher values of both of these will cause the volume
                    cutout to take longer to generate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To generate these visuals, flip back to the 'calculation' tab of the tool
                    and press <button>calculate % buried volume for selected centers</button>.
