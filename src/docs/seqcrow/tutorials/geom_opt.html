        <p>
            Any property you calculate from theoritical chemistry will require a structure.
            From a mathematical view, the energy of a molecule is a function of the
            coordinates of its atoms. The probability of a molecule having a particular
            geometry can be described by a Boltzmann population. Therefore, the structures
            you are most likely to see (and measure in a labrotory setting) are located
            at an energy minima. So, if we want to simulate something comparable to 
            the real world, we want to use a structure close to the energy minimum.

            Of course, many molecules
