	<h2>SEQCROW Tutorials</h2>
	
	<p>
		Welcome to the tutorials on computing properties of molecules! These tutorials will
        walk through the steps to calculate different features, such as simulated spectra and
        structure descriptors. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These tutorials will use a mix of SEQCROW, <a href="https://github.com/QChASM/AaronTools.py/wiki">
        AaronTools</a>, and the various quantum chemistry software packages that AaronTools and SEQCROW can
        work with. Currently, this includes
        <b>LINK THESE </b>
        Gaussian 09 and 16,
        ORCA,
        Psi4,
        and Q-Chem.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will be advantageous to have access to a computing cluster with AaronTools
        installed, as well as one or more quantum chemistry software package. 
        Although all of these calculations could be run a personal computer with a local installation
        of a quantum chemistry program installed, a computing cluster will have more computational power
        than a desktop computer or laptop, and computations can be run in parallel.
        This will significantly decrease the time it takes to calculate these properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        AaronTools
        will allow for intermediate computations to be processed without having to copy files
        from the cluster to your local computer. SEQCROW provides much of the functionality of
        AaronTools in its various tools, so everything will be possible without AaronTools.
        Using AaronTools will, however, sometimes be more convenient than using SEQCROW when
        processing calculations on a cluster without graphical capabilities.
