# SEQCROW
SEQCROW is an AaronTools-based plugin for <a href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/" target="_blank">UCSF ChimeraX</a>, a cross-platform 3D molecular graphics program.
SEQCROW extends ChimeraX by adding tools to build and modify complex molecular structures, map new catalysts and ligands onto previously-computed structures, and manage AaronTools libraries.
These tools enable users to rapidly modify several structures simultaneously, providing an intuitive interface to build libraries of the complex molecular structures frequently encountered in modern quantum chemistry applications.

More information about SEQCROW features can be found on the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/QChASM/SEQCROW/wiki).
Several tutorials for SEQCROW's tools can be found under ChimeraX's Help menu

* <b>Ligand Solid Angle</b> - solid angle cast by shadow of ligand's VDW radii

#### Structure Editing

* <b>Transition State Structures</b> - locate potential transition state structures using reaction path interpolation methods


### Selectors
* <b>tm</b>  - select all d-block elements
* <b>connected</b> - expand selection to all atoms with a bonding path to the current selection
* <b>rings</b> - any atom in a ring
* several substituent selectors, including <b>Me</b>, <b>Et</b>, <b>iPr</b>, <b>tBu</b>, <b>Ph</b>, <b>COOCH3</b>, and <b>SuperMes</b>
  * more substituent selectors can be added by adding substituents with the <b>Add to Personal Library</b> tool
  * these selectors depend only on elements and bonding patterns, not atom name, serial number, residue, <i>etc.</i>


### Mouse Modes
These can be activated using the <code>mousemode</code> command or the "More Right Mouse" tab on ChimeraX's toolbar

* <b>select fragment</b> - select everything with a bonding path to clicked atoms or bonds
* <b>select same types</b> - select all fragments that are the same as the clicked fragment
* <b>bond</b> - click and drag from one atom to another to draw a bond
* <b>tsbond</b> - click and drag from one atom to another to draw a forming/breaking bond
* <b>change element</b> - click an atom to change its element or VSEPR shape
* <b>erase structure</b> - click atoms or bonds to delete them
* <b>substitute</b> - click an atom to replace it with a substituent

### Graphical Presets
* <b>ball-stick-endcap</b>       - all non-H atoms are represented as balls and sticks; H atoms are represented as sticks/endcaps
* <b>ball-stick-endcap 2</b> - apply ball-stick-endcap to visible atoms only
* <b>index labels</b>            - label each atom with its index (1-indexed)
* <b>sticks</b> - all heavy atoms are represented as sticks/endcaps, most hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon are hidden
* <b>sticks 2</b> - apply sticks to visible atoms only
* <b>VDW</b> - all atoms are represented as VDW spheres

In SEQCROW's settings (Favorites/Preferences &rarr; Settings... &rarr; SEQCROW), you can automatically apply one of SEQCROW's presets to a molecule opened with SEQCROW (<i>i.e.</i> from an XYZ, log, dat, <i>etc.</i> file).

### Commands
* <b>fuseRing</b> - attach a ring to a structure
* <b>highlight</b> (<b>~highlight</b>) - outline atoms and bonds so they stand out more
* <b>rmsdAlign</b> - calculate RMSD and align molecular structures, similar to ChimeraX's built-in `align` command
* <b>sterimol</b> - print Sterimol L, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>4</sub>, and B<sub>5</sub> of the selected substituents to the log
* <b>substitute</b> - add or change substituents
* <b>tsbond</b> (<b>~tsbond</b>) - display (erase) forming/breaking bond
* <b>percentVolumeBuried</b> - calculate volume buried by ligands around a metal center
* <b>pointGroup</b> - print the point group (Sch√∂nflies) to the log

### Running jobs through SEQCROW
QM computations can be run through SEQCROW if the appropriate QM software is installed. If you are running computations on the same computer running ChimeraX, specify the executable for the software in the "SEQCROW Jobs" section of the ChimeraX settings/preferences. If you are running ChimeraX on a computing cluster, jobs can be submitted to run on the cluster. The cluster's queuing software needs to be specified in the "SEQCROW Jobs" section of the ChimeraX settings/preferences. To run the computations, go to the "run" menu on either the QM Input Builder, Transition State Structure, or Conformer Search tool. When running jobs on a cluster, ensure the job submission template is appropriate for how the QM software is installed on the cluster.

## Installation
1. On the ChimeraX menu, go to Tools &rarr; More Tools...
2. find the SEQCROW page and click install
3. restart ChimeraX
